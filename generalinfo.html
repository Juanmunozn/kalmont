                    <h2>What is Hypothermia</h2>
                        <p>Hypothermia is a medical condition where the body loses heat faster than it can produce it, resulting in a dangerously low core body temperature. It commonly occurs in cold environments but can also happen in milder temperatures if a person becomes wet. Symptoms include shivering, confusion, fatigue, and loss of coordination. Severe cases can lead to unconsciousness and death if left untreated. Prevention involves dressing appropriately for the weather, staying dry, and seeking shelter from wind and moisture, especially during outdoor activities in cold environments.</p>
