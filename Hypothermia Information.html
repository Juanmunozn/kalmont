        <h1>Signs and Stages</h1>
        <p>Hypothermia is a condition where the body loses heat faster than it can produce it, leading to a dangerously low core body temperature. Recognizing the signs and stages of hypothermia is crucial for prompt intervention and treatment. Here are the signs and stages:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="stage mild">
            <h2>Mild Hypothermia</h2>
            <p>(Core temperature 90-95°F or 32-35°C)</p>
            <!-- The image will be added as a background via CSS -->
            <div class="symptoms">
                <ul>
                    <li>Shivering: The body's natural response to generate heat.</li>
                    <li>Cold extremities: Hands and feet may feel cold and numb.</li>
                    <li>Pale skin: Skin may appear pale or bluish due to reduced blood flow to the extremities.</li>
                    <li>Slurred speech: Speech may become slow or difficult to understand.</li>
                    <li>Difficulty performing fine motor tasks: Decreased dexterity and coordination.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="stage moderate">
            <h2>Moderate Hypothermia</h2>
            <p>(Core temperature 82-90°F or 28-32°C)</p>
            <!-- The image will be added as a background via CSS -->
            <div class="symptoms">
                <ul>
                    <li>Intensified symptoms: Shivering may become more intense initially but then decrease as the body loses its ability to generate heat.</li>
                    <li>Confusion and altered mental status: Disorientation, confusion, and impaired judgment.</li>
                    <li>Loss of coordination: Difficulty walking or standing, stumbling, and poor balance.</li>
                    <li>Slowed heart rate and breathing: Heart rate and breathing may become slow and irregular.</li>
                </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="stage severe">
            <h2>Severe Hypothermia</h2>
            <p>(Core temperature below 82°F or 28°C)</p>
            <!-- The image will be added as a background via CSS -->
            <div class="symptoms">
                <ul>
                    <li>Medical emergency: Severe hypothermia is life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.</li>
                    <li>Loss of consciousness: The person may become unconscious and unresponsive.</li>
                    <li>Weak or absent pulse: The pulse may be weak or difficult to detect.</li>
                    <li>Shallow or absent breathing: Breathing may be slow, shallow, or absent.</li>
                    <li>Dilated pupils: Pupils may be dilated and unreactive to light.</li>
